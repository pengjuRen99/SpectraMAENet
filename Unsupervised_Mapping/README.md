In the training set of bacteria_ID, the classical reduction and clustering methods were compared to show the effect and accuracy of Bacteria_ID.    

After PCA initialization of T-SNE and UMAP, KNN, GMM and DESCAN were applied to determine the embedded cluster classification, and the classification accuracy was obtained, which was compared with SMAE.
